# Atari-Mads-Includes
A collection of assembly language include files for use with the Mads assembler.  The include files cover Atari DOS, OS, custom chips, etc.

I'm sure someone else has done a better version of includes.  These are the OS values and macros I need for the programs I have written.   
Primarily, this is the standard custom chips, OS shadow values, CIO, and common interfaces/vectors in the OS.  
There are come memory management and bitmap macros for creating tables of shifted byte values at Assembly time.   
There is not so much here for lower level Serial I/O and device-specific functionality.
