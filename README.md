# Atari-Mads-Includes
A collection of assembly language include files for Mads for Atari DOS, OS, custom chips, etc.

I'm sure someone else has done a better version of includes.  This is what I need for what I have coded.   Primarily this is the standard custom chips, OS shadow values, CIO, and common interfaces/vectors in the OS.  Not so much here for lower level Serial I/O and device-specific functionality.
