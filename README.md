# Atari-Mads-Includes
A collection of assembly language include files for Mads for Atari DOS, OS, custom chips, etc.

I'm sure someone else has done a better version of includes.  This are the OS values and macros I need for the programs I have written.   Primarily this is the standard custom chips, OS shadow values, CIO, and common interfaces/vectors in the OS.  Some memory management and bitmap macros for creating tables of shifted byte values at Assemnly time.   Not so much here for lower level Serial I/O and device-specific functionality.
